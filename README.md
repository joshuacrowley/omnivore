## About

Cookbook kitchen is an attempt to cram most of Open AI’s APIs into a humble meal planning app that just runs in your browser.

It’s a toy app, meant to be run locally off your home computer and not deployed remotely. CK uses Airtable as backend. I think it’s easy to hack, tweak, so you can understand how these experiences come together. I’ll be very happy if create an experience where you can reflect on your engagement with the app and it’s assistant Chef CK, over a few weekends to understand the strengths and weaknesses when building AI features. We’re gonna make a mess.

I’ve made a zine which explains the design process behind the app, my reflections using the app, and some early adopters experience of using the app, as well.

I hope you have a fun few weekends with it, learning about the APIs and getting inspired about building multi-modal apps.
