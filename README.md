## About

Omnivore is an ongoing attempt to cram most of Open AI’s APIs into a humble meal planning app that just runs in your browser. I'm using it to learn, and I hope it helps you learn too!

It’s a toy app, meant to be run locally off your home computer/network and not deployed remotely. Omnivore uses Airtable as backend. I think it’s easy to hack, tweak, so you can understand how these experiences come together. I’ll be very happy if create an experience where you can reflect on your engagement with the app and it’s assistant Chef CK, over a few weekends to understand the strengths and weaknesses when building AI features. We’re gonna make a mess.

I hope you have a fun few weekends with it, learning about the APIs and getting inspired about building Omnimodal apps.
