# Mushroom Quesadillas

- Extra-virgin olive oil | 3 tbsp | 
- Portobello mushrooms' | 200 g | sliced 8 mm thick (or other mushrooms of choice)
- Chipotle powder | ½ tsp |
- Salt | ½ tsp | - Black pepper | ¼ tsp |
- Shredded cheese | 75 g | 
- Corn flour tortillas | 4 | 20 cm each


1. **Cook mushrooms** – Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook for 1 minute, using a spatula to toss them regularly. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, toss to coat the mushrooms, then add the chipotle powder, salt, and pepper. Cook for a further 1½ minutes until the surface of the mushrooms is golden. Transfer the mushrooms to a bowl and wipe any loose bits out of the pan with a paper towel. 
2. **Assemble quesadilla** – Sprinkle half the cheese on one half of a tortilla, top with half the mushrooms, then fold the other half over. Repeat with the other tortilla. 
3. **Cook quesadillas** – Return the frying pan to the stove on medium heat (no extra oil is needed). Transfer the tortillas to the frying pan and cook for 1½ minutes until crisp and golden. Flip and cook for a further 1 minute until crisp. 
4. **Serve** – Cut each quesadilla in half and serve with sour cream and Pico de Gallo, Guacamole or Avocado Crema for dunking. Finish with a squeeze of lime.
