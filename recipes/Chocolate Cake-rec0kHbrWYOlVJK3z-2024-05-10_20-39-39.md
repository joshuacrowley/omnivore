1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round baking pans.
2. In a large bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
3. In another large bowl, beat together the eggs, sugar, milk, oil, and vanilla. Gradually add the dry ingredients and mix until smooth.
4. Stir in boiling water (batter will be thin). Pour evenly into the prepared pans.
