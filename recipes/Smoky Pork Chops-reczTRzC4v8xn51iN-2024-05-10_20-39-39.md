# Smoky Pork Chops

- Boneless pork chops | 4 x 150g 
- Smoked paprika | 1 tbsp 
- Cooking salt | 2 tsp 
- Garlic powder | 2 tsp 
- Onion powder | 1 tsp 
- Dried oregano | 1 tsp 
- Ground cumin | 1 tsp 
- Ground sage | 1 tsp 
- Black pepper | 0.5 tsp 
- Olive oil | 1.5 tbsp 
- Unsalted butter | 50 g


1. **Smoky pork rub** - Mix the rub ingredients in a small bowl.
2. **Prepare pork** - Pat the pork chops dry with a paper towel. Sprinkle both sides evenly with the rub â€“ use it all!
3. **Cook** - Heat the oil in a large non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat. Cook the pork chops on each side until deep golden. Don't crowd the pan or the pork will stew instead of sear!
4. **Rest** - Let the pork rest on the rack for 3 minutes.
5. **Make sauce** - Melt the butter in the same pan, stirring to dissolve the rub that's left in the pan until the butter has formed into sauce.
6. **Serve** - Transfer the pork to serving plates, pour over the melted butter and serve.
