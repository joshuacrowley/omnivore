# Garlic Bread Pizza

- Turkish bread, split in half lengthwise | 1 piece | - Garlic cloves, crushed using garlic crusher | 2 cloves | - Unsalted butter | 50 g | - Finely chopped parsley | 1 tbsp | Optional - Cooking salt | ¼ tsp | - Tomato passata | 1 cup (260 g) | - Caster sugar | 2 tsp | - Red onion, finely sliced | ½ | - Shredded mozzarella | 1½ cups (150 g) | - White mushrooms, sliced 5 mm thick | 6 | - Finely sliced salami, cut into 1 x 0.5 cm strips | 100 g |


1. **Preheat oven** to 200°C (180°C fan-forced). If your baking tray isn't long enough for the Turkish bread, take out an oven shelf and cover it with foil.
2. **Garlic butter**: Melt the butter with the garlic and stir in the parsley (if using) and salt. Mix the ingredients together in a small bowl
3. **Bake bread**: Place the bread cut face down on the tray. Lightly brush with a bit of melted garlic butter (reserve most of the butter for the cut side). Bake for 5 minutes. Flip, brush the cut side with the remaining garlic butter (scoop up all the garlic bits), then bake for 5 minutes.
4. **Apply sauce and toppings**: Spread the pizza sauce right to the edge, then sprinkle with onion followed by cheese. Top with the mushrooms, then sprinkle with salami.
5. **Final baking**: Bake for 10 minutes or until the cheese on the edges is golden. Cut into slices and serve!
