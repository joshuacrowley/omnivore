# Smoky Pork Chops

- Boneless pork chops | 4 x 150g
- Olive oil | 1½ tsp
- Unsalted butter | 50g
- Smoked paprika | 1 tsp
- Cooking salt | 2 tsp
- Garlic powder | 1½ tsp
- Onion powder | 1 tsp
- Dried oregano | 1 tsp
- Ground black pepper | ½ tsp
- Ground cumin | ½ tsp
- Ground sage | ½ tsp

1. Mix the rub ingredients in a small bowl.
2. Pat the pork chops dry with a paper towel. Sprinkle both sides evenly with the rub – use it all.
3. Prepare a rack over a tray (for resting).
4. Heat the oil in a large non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat. Cook the chops for 3 minutes on each side until deep golden. Don't crowd the pan or the pork will stew instead of sear!
5. Rest the pork on the rack for 3 minutes.
6. Add butter to the pan, allow it to melt in the remaining juices, stirring to dissolve the rub that's left.
7. Serve by transferring the pork to serving plates, pour the melted butter and serve. These are great with creamy mashed potatoes.
